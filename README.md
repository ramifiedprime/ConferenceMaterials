# Conference Materials
The classes here are intended to streamline the production of paraphernalia associated to mathematics conferences:  namely a conference booklet and some name badges.

## What do?
There is a short blurb in the docs folder on the main functionalities.  Reading this, and possibly referring to ConferenceBooklet.sty, will allow a reader to adapt the examples to their own use-case.  At some point I will put some proper documentation here.  For now:  clone and play.

## Disclaimers
No serious ownerships are claimed in the writing, at some point I may look into making it more professional and adding it to CTAN but for now:  here are some things I made to make making conference booklets less painful.
